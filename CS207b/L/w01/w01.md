# Description

The `statement` function in the `Customer` class is used to generate a detailed statement for a customer's movie rentals. It calculates the total amount due for the rentals, the number of frequent renter points earned, and returns a formatted string with this information.

The function starts by initializing `total_amount` and `frequent_renter_points` to 0. `total_amount` will hold the total cost of all rentals, while `frequent_renter_points` will hold the total number of points earned from the rentals. The `result` string is initialized with a header line that includes the customer's name, retrieved by calling the get_name method.

The function then iterates over each rental in the \_\_rentals list. For each rental, it initializes this_amount to 0, which will hold the cost of this particular rental.

The function then checks the price code of the movie being rented, which can be `REGULAR`, `NEW_RELEASE`, or `CHILDRENS`. Depending on the price code, it calculates the cost of the rental and updates this_amount accordingly. For `REGULAR` and `CHILDRENS` movies, there's an additional charge if the movie is rented for more than 2 or 3 days, respectively.

Next, the function increments `frequent_renter_points` by 1 for each rental. If the rental is a `NEW_RELEASE` and it's rented for more than 1 day, an additional bonus point is added.

The function then appends a line to the `result` string with the title of the movie and the cost of the rental. It also adds this_amount to `total_amount`.

After iterating over all rentals, the function appends two footer lines to the `result` string: one with the total amount owed, and one with the total number of frequent renter points earned.

Finally, the function returns the `result` string, which is the complete statement for the customer's rentals.

# Criticism

The price code should be a separated class since it holds many properties realated to calculating the price of a rental, such as base rate, days before late fee, late fee rate, etc. This would make it easier to add new price codes in the future, and would also make the `statement` function simpler.

The `statement` function is too long and does too many things. It should be broken up into smaller functions:

-   Function to calculate the total amount owed for all rentals. This can be placed inside `Rental.java` since it only uses information from the `Rental` and `Movie` classes.
-   Function to calculate the total number of frequent renter points earned.
-   Function to generate the statement string.
