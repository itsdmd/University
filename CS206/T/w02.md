4. What rule of inference is used in each of these arguments?
a) Kangaroos live inAustralia and are marsupials. There-
fore, kangaroos are marsupials.
b) It is either hotter than 100 degrees today or the pollu-
tion is dangerous. It is less than 100 degrees outside
today. Therefore, the pollution is dangerous.
c) Linda is an excellent swimmer. If Linda is an excellent
swimmer, then she can work as a lifeguard. Therefore,
Linda can work as a lifeguard.
d) Steve will work at a computer company this summer.
Therefore, this summer Steve will work at a computer
company or he will be a beach bum.
e) If I work all night on this homework, then I can an-
swer all the exercises. If I answer all the exercises, I
will understand the material. Therefore, if I work all
